As of 2007-10-11 this is the structure of the repository

  * lib/
  * script4g/
  * snookr4g/
  * snookrlib/

= script4g =
  Client groovy code:
  * *fs.groovy* : File system synch : fs<-->db
  * *db.groovy* : Perform db4o tests, '(on test.yap)'
    * Dao patterns/strategy exploation.
  * *thread.groovy* : show example use of spawner
  * *flickrClient* : Mostly obsoleted by flickrSynch, but has interesting date stuff to salvage.
  * *flickrSynch.groovy* : Flickr synch: flickr<-->db, should compltete move to DAO from Db byFetching through DAO and also moving createOrUpdate into DAO, otherwise this is done, and using setExtras(..,tags); the tail end compares different strategies for synching db<-->flickr list. 

= snookr4g =
Supporting implementation for flickr services...

= snookrlib =
  Legacy import of the original _org.galo_ java code, sitting on *com.aetrion.flickr* package in  *flickrapi-1.0b4.jar*

  * Closest thing to a workable program is SnookrTest in org.galo
  * Refactored and rebuilding in SonkrTest2, attempting to make 'searchParams.setExtras(true);' modifiy behavior for tags.
